# Marshak 3T
This folder contains codes that solve the 3T Marshak wave
"MarshakWave 3T" plots self-similar solutions to the 3T problem and can be set to reproduce the analytic 2T solution. This notebook also writes files which can be checked against the numerical diffusion solver "Marshak_Verification_3T".

"initial_conditions" contains the RHS functions and initial conditions used in the "MarshakWave 3T", "Marshak_Wave_gamma_plots", and "MarshakWave_temperature_plots".

"Marshak_Wave_gamma_plots" plots the location of the value of $\gamma_0$ vs the location of the wavefront for space and time dependent electron-ion coupling coefficients. 

"MarshakWave_temperature_plots" produces plots for a few values of $\gamma_0$ for the space and time dependent coupling coefficients and for m=0 and m=3/2 (m is a parameter that determines the dependence of the coupling coefficient $\gamma$ on the electron temperature).
